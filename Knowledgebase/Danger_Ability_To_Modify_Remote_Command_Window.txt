Its content is created by the set_progress calls, each one resulting in a row in the database.

You can access these by:

# a queryset of lines shown in the Results section
job.progressmessage_set.all()


Now, to modify or remove the message record that contains output from a remote script (green text on black background in the job details view):

# There is usually only one of these per job.
message = j.progressmessage_set.exclude(detailed_message='').first()

# print all the lines of remote execution output
print message.detailed_message

# Clear the remote execution output
message.detailed_message = ''
message.save()

# Or delete this message completely from the job's progress
message.delete()

I generally DO NOT recommend doing this because YOU MAY LOSE IMPORTANT INFORMATION.
But if you know what you are doing, there are some pretty amazing things you can do with it.
